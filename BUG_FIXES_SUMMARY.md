# Bug Fixes Summary

This document details the 4 critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the codebase.

## Bug #1: Security Vulnerability in Firebase Initialization

**File**: `backend/app/firebase_init.py`
**Type**: Security Vulnerability
**Severity**: Critical

### Description
The Firebase initialization code contained a serious security flaw that created a bypass mechanism allowing unauthorized access. When Firebase private key environment variables were missing, the code would fall back to hardcoded dummy credentials, which could be exploited in production environments.

### Issues Found
- Fallback dummy credentials with hardcoded values
- No proper validation of required environment variables
- Silent failure mode that could hide authentication bypass

### Fix Applied
```python
# Before: Insecure fallback
if not firebase_private_key:
    # Create a dummy app for development
    cred = credentials.Certificate({
        "project_id": "dummy-project",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\ndummy\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        # ... other dummy values
    })

# After: Secure validation
if not all([firebase_private_key, firebase_project_id, firebase_client_email]):
    missing_vars = []
    # ... collect missing variables
    raise ValueError(f"Missing required Firebase environment variables: {', '.join(missing_vars)}")
```

### Security Impact
- **Before**: Potential authentication bypass in production
- **After**: Proper validation ensures Firebase credentials are required in production mode

## Bug #2: Logic Error in Inventory API

**File**: `backend/app/api/inventory.py` (line ~183)
**Type**: Logic Error
**Severity**: High

### Description
The `create_inventory_item` function had incorrect tuple unpacking when accessing the document ID from Firestore's `add()` method return value.

### Issues Found
- Incorrect assumption about Firestore `add()` return value structure
- Code attempted to access `doc_ref[1].id` when it should be `doc_ref.id`
- Would cause runtime AttributeError when creating inventory items

### Fix Applied
```python
# Before: Incorrect tuple unpacking
doc_ref = db.collection("inventory").add(item_data)
return {"id": doc_ref[1].id, **item_data}

# After: Correct tuple unpacking and ID access
update_time, doc_ref = db.collection("inventory").add(item_data)
return {"id": doc_ref.id, **item_data}
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Runtime error when creating new inventory items
- **After**: Proper document creation and ID retrieval

## Bug #3: Logic Error in Frontend Authentication Context

**File**: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (line 9)
**Type**: Logic Error
**Severity**: Medium

### Description
The DEV_MODE variable had a logical flaw where it would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the environment variable setting due to an incorrect OR condition.

### Issues Found
- Expression `env?.VITE_DEV_MODE === 'true' || true` always returns `true`
- Application would always run in development mode
- Production builds would have development authentication behavior

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Before: Always true
const DEV_MODE = (import.meta as any).env?.VITE_DEV_MODE === 'true' || true

// After: Only true when explicitly set
const DEV_MODE = (import.meta as any).env?.VITE_DEV_MODE === 'true'
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Application always ran in development mode
- **After**: Proper environment-based mode switching

## Bug #4: Performance Issue in Cache Implementation

**File**: `backend/app/cache.py` (line 67)
**Type**: Performance Issue
**Severity**: Medium

### Description
The cache key generation used a simple hash of string representations which could cause hash collisions between different function calls, leading to incorrect cache hits.

### Issues Found
- Simple `hash()` function on string concatenation prone to collisions
- Cache keys didn't include module information
- Different functions with same arguments could share cache entries

### Fix Applied
```python
# Before: Collision-prone hashing
cache_key = f"{key_prefix}:{func.__name__}:{hash(str(args) + str(kwargs))}"

# After: Robust hashing with collision prevention
import hashlib
args_str = str(args) + str(sorted(kwargs.items()))
hash_value = hashlib.md5(args_str.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
cache_key = f"{key_prefix}:{func.__module__}:{func.__name__}:{hash_value}"
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Potential cache pollution and incorrect results
- **After**: Unique cache keys prevent cross-function collisions

---

## Summary

### Security Improvements
