# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Wrong Dependencies**: The deployment was installing Flask dependencies instead of FastAPI dependencies
2. **Missing uvicorn**: The `uvicorn: command not found` error indicated uvicorn wasn't installed
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: The deployment platform wasn't properly using the backend directory structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Root Requirements File
- Added `requirements.txt` in the root directory with correct FastAPI dependencies
- Includes `uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0`, `fastapi==0.104.1`, and all other necessary packages

### 2. Updated Render Configuration
- Modified `render.yaml` to use simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` build command
- Changed start command to `uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Removed `rootDir: backend` to avoid path confusion

### 3. Added Platform Compatibility Files
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies Python 3.13.3 version
- `Procfile`: Alternative deployment configuration for platforms that use it

## Expected Result

The deployment should now:
1. ✅ Install correct FastAPI dependencies including uvicorn
2. ✅ Successfully start the FastAPI application 
3. ✅ Serve the Smart Stock Ordering API on the specified port

## Verification

The FastAPI app structure is confirmed working:
- Main app file: `backend/app/main.py`
- Module path: `backend.app.main:app`
- All required dependencies in root `requirements.txt`

## Next Steps

1. Redeploy using the updated configuration
2. The API should be accessible at the deployment URL
3. Health check endpoint: `/health`
4. API documentation: `/docs`
