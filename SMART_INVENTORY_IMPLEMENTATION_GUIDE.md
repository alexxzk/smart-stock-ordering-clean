## ðŸš€ **Quick Start Implementation**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Ingredient Database**

```python
# Example: Create Avocado ingredient
POST /api/ingredients/

{
  "name": "Avocado",
  "category": "produce", 
  "unit_type": "grams",
  "cost_per_unit": 0.008,  # $0.008 per gram
  "current_stock": 5000,   # 5kg in stock
  "min_stock_threshold": 1000,  # Reorder at 1kg
  "max_stock_capacity": 10000,  # Max 10kg storage
  "supplier_id": "fresh-produce-co",
  "package_size": 1000,    # Bought in 1kg packages
  "package_cost": 8.50,    # $8.50 per kg
  "shelf_life_days": 7,
  "storage_requirements": "refrigerated"
}
```

### **Step 2: Create Your Dishes with Recipes**

```python
# Create Avocado Toast dish
POST /api/dishes/

{
  "name": "Avocado Toast",
  "category": "main",
  "selling_price": 12.50,
  "prep_time_minutes": 8,
  "description": "Fresh avocado on toasted sourdough",
  "allergens": ["gluten"]
}

# Add ingredients to the recipe
POST /api/dishes/{dish_id}/ingredients

{
  "ingredient_id": "avocado-123",
  "quantity_needed": 80,    # 80g per serving
  "unit": "grams",
  "is_critical": true
}

{
  "ingredient_id": "sourdough-456", 
  "quantity_needed": 2,     # 2 slices per serving
  "unit": "pieces",
  "is_critical": true
}
```

### **Step 3: Process Sales and Auto-Deduct Stock**

```python
# Record a sale (automatically deducts ingredients)
POST /api/dishes/sales/record-sale

{
  "dish_id": "avocado-toast-789",
  "quantity_sold": 5,       # 5 Avocado Toasts sold
  "pos_reference": "TXN-12345"
}

# System automatically:
# - Deducts 400g avocado (80g Ã— 5)
# - Deducts 10 bread slices (2 Ã— 5)
# - Records transaction history
# - Calculates profit margin
# - Updates stock levels
```

### **Step 4: Monitor and Analyze**

```python
# Get dish profitability analysis
GET /api/dishes/profitability?days=30

# Get detailed cost breakdown for a dish
GET /api/dishes/{dish_id}/cost-breakdown

# Check low stock alerts
GET /api/ingredients/low-stock

# Get ingredient usage analytics
GET /api/reports/ingredient-usage
```
