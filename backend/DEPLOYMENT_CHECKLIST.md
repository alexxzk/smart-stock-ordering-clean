- [ ] Triggered deployment

### Verification
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Service is running

## üåê Render Deployment (Alternative)

### Account Setup
- [ ] Created Render account
- [ ] Connected GitHub account

### Service Setup
- [ ] Created new Web Service
- [ ] Connected repository
- [ ] Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Set start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- [ ] Added all environment variables
- [ ] Deployed service

### Verification
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Service is running
- [ ] Health check passes: `/health`
- [ ] API docs accessible: `/docs`

## üß™ Testing

### Run Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_deployment.py https://your-deployment-url
```

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Health endpoint: `GET /health`
- [ ] Root endpoint: `GET /`
- [ ] API documentation: `GET /docs`
- [ ] Firestore test: `GET /test-firestore`
- [ ] Authentication endpoints (if needed)

## üîó Frontend Integration

### Update Frontend Configuration
- [ ] Update API base URL in frontend
- [ ] Test frontend-backend connection
- [ ] Verify CORS is working

### Environment Variables for Frontend
- [ ] `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-deployment-url`
- [ ] Firebase config for frontend authentication

## üìä Monitoring

### Set Up Monitoring
- [ ] Enable logging in deployment platform
- [ ] Set up error notifications (optional)
- [ ] Monitor API usage and performance

### Common Issues to Watch For
- [ ] Environment variables not set correctly
- [ ] Firebase credentials issues
- [ ] Port configuration problems
- [ ] CORS issues with frontend
- [ ] Memory/CPU limits

## üéâ Post-Deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with deployment URL
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### Security
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules
- [ ] Enable authentication in production
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins
- [ ] Review API rate limiting

### Performance
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Optimize if needed

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Problems
1. **Build Failures**
   - Check `requirements.txt`
   - Verify Python version compatibility
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify Firebase credentials
   - Check logs for specific errors

3. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify CORS configuration
   - Check network connectivity
   - Test with curl or Postman

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Test local deployment
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Test deployment
python test_deployment.py https://your-url

# Check logs (platform specific)
# Railway: Check Deployments tab
# Render: Check Logs tab
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the deployment platform logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test locally first
4. Check the troubleshooting section in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
