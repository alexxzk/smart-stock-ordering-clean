# Supplier Integrations Testing Guide

## âœ… What Was Just Implemented

I've successfully added the missing backend endpoints to make your Supplier Integrations page work properly:

### New Backend Endpoints Added:

#### 1. **GET /api/supplier-integrations/suppliers**
Returns list of available suppliers for integration:
- Sysco Corporation
- US Foods  
- Gordon Food Service
- Reinhart FoodService
- Performance Food Group

#### 2. **POST /api/supplier-integrations/pricing**
Get real-time pricing for items from suppliers.

#### 3. **POST /api/supplier-integrations/order**
Place orders directly with suppliers.

### Frontend Updates:
- Fixed authentication token handling
- Added error handling and fallback mock data
- Improved API response handling

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### 1. Start Your Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access Supplier Integrations

Go to: `http://localhost:5173/supplier-integrations`

Or click **"Supplier Integrations"** in the sidebar (newly added)

### 3. Test Features

#### **Available Suppliers Section:**
- You should see 5 supplier cards with different integration types:
  - **Sysco Corporation** (API)
  - **US Foods** (API) 
  - **Gordon Food Service** (Web Scraping)
  - **Reinhart FoodService** (Email)
  - **Performance Food Group** (API)

#### **Get Pricing Feature:**
1. Click on any supplier card to select it
2. In the "Get Pricing" section, enter items like: `coffee beans, milk, sugar`
3. You should see real-time pricing appear with:
   - Item names
   - Prices in USD
   - Units (lb/each)
   - Last updated timestamp

#### **Place Order Feature:**
1. Select a supplier
2. Fill in delivery address
3. Add order items (name, quantity, unit, price)
4. Click "Place Order"
5. You should get a success message with Order ID

## ðŸ“Š API Testing (Direct)

### Test Suppliers Endpoint:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/supplier-integrations/suppliers
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "suppliers": {
    "sysco": {
      "id": "sysco",
      "name": "Sysco Corporation",
      "integration_type": "api",
      "features": ["Real-time Pricing", "Order Placement", "Delivery Tracking", "Invoice Management"]
    }
    // ... more suppliers
  },
  "total_count": 5
}
```

### Test Pricing Endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/supplier-integrations/pricing \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "supplier_id": "sysco",
    "items": ["coffee beans", "milk", "sugar"]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "supplier_id": "sysco",
  "pricing": [
    {
      "itemId": "sysco_coffee_beans",
      "itemName": "Coffee Beans",
      "price": 25.99,
      "currency": "USD",
      "unit": "each",
      "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
      "supplierId": "sysco"
    }
    // ... more items
  ]
}
```

### Test Order Placement:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/supplier-integrations/order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "supplier_id": "sysco",
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Coffee Beans",
        "quantity": 2,
        "unit": "lb",
        "price": 25.99
      }
    ],
    "deliveryAddress": "123 Main St, City, State",
    "notes": "Deliver to back entrance"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "orderId": "ORD-20240101-1234",
  "status": "pending",
  "totalCost": 51.98,
  "estimatedDelivery": "2024-01-03",
  "message": "Order ORD-20240101-1234 placed successfully with sysco"
}
```
